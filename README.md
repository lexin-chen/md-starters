# OpioidProject

This repository compiles all of my descriptions/ scripts for my first Ph.D. project, which harnesses supercomputers to investigate ligand-receptor interactions in the Âµ-opioid receptor, a membrane protein responsible for pain relief. 

Here is a link to a non-holistic compilation of my [literature review](https://burnitup.notion.site/e737c55c72e44f54a10106ed8e15929e?v=ab0a65ab843a4b17ad573318634d067f).
