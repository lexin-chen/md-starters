#to get started

common_files where you put config file, psf, pdb
tstate file where you define target state
bstate directory is where you put all ur restart .xsc .vel .coor


west.cfg - where you define bins; 
	make sure pcoord lim = # of time you are outputting dcdfreq
	bin_target_count= # of starting trajectories

#about westpa_scripts directory
w_init calls for westpa_scripts/get_pcoord.sh so if there's an error edit that file.
you need a pdb file of the last frame of your MD simulation so you can run get_pcoord.sh

then you submit jobs	

#submitting jobs#
NEW_sub.sh is submission script used in parallel with multiple GPU
run.sh is submission script for running in serial

w_run calls for westpa_scripts/runseg.sh. If you wanna stop or change anything you rename that and submit again. 

if you make error in anything delete the traj_seg of that iteration and the corresponding seg_log and you need to delete it from west.h5 using command "w_truncate -n 100" if you want to get rid of anything after ite. 99.

westpa_scripts/analysis.py can be used if "w_pdist gives you an error about cannot read the h5 file"
